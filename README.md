# Midway Python
An Intermediate python lessons after you have learned the python basics. 
Before you take these lessons you should have completed a intro to python course. Here are a few begining 
courses I can recommend. 

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.com)
* [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf)

I have taught python programing based on both of these courses and find them a good intro class.


## Course Overview

The course is several small lessons that each build on each other. In the course we will write a simple
API that shows results from made up Midway Horse racing game. We will write the API using [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/)
After writing the API we will setup the application in Docker and make decisions about deployment. 
The plan is for this course to take 4 days of on-site training.

Each Lesson is in its own folder. Each lesson builds on the previous one.
