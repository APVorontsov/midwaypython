# Setup

For this class you will need a Mac OSX system or Linux System. This class might work on windows but I 
will not provide setup instructions for windows. I have tested this both on OSX Mojave and Ubuntu 
Linux 16.04. In this directory you will find two files one for the Mac Setup and one for the linux setup. 

## Steps
